# U2.W5: Class Warfare, Validate a Credit Card Number


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input: a 16 digit integer
# Output: boolean operator (true or false)
# Steps:
# start by asserting that the input integer is 16 digits long
# pass 


# 3. Initial Solution

# Don't forget to check on intialization for a card length
# of exactly 16 digits
class CreditCard

end



# 4. Refactored Solution






# 1. DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
card = CreditCard.new(4408041234567893)
p card.check_card == true

card = CreditCard.new(4408041234567892)      
p card.check_card == false
