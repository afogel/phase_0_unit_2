# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].


# 2. Pseudocode



# 3. Initial Solution
class BoggleBoard
 
  #your code here
 
end
 
 
dice_grid = [["b", "r", "a", "e"],
             ["i", "o", "d", "t"],
             ["e", "c", "l", "r"],
             ["t", "a", "k", "e"]]
 
boggle_board = BoggleBoard.new(dice_grid)
 


# 4. Refactored Solution






# 1. DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
# create driver test code to retrieve a value at a coordinate here:
# implement tests for each of the methods here:


# 5. Reflection 
# What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
# My entire strategy worked. The problem I had was knowing how to refactor the DRY code.
# 
# What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
# I was wondering whether I needed to use class or instance variables. I read a StackOverflwo article
# on it:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3802540/difference-between-class-variables-and-class-instance-variables
#
